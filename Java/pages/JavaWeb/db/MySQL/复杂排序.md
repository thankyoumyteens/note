# 使用 union all

排序规则 age小于18 > sex == 0 > 按照名字排序

```sql
( SELECT i.*,1 AS sort FROM info AS i WHERE age < 18 AND sex = 0   ORDER BY convert('name' using gbk) asc LIMIT 999999) 
UNION ALL
(SELECT	 i.*,2 AS sort FROM info AS i WHERE age < 18  AND sex = 1  ORDER BY convert('name' using gbk) asc LIMIT 999999)
UNION ALL
(SELECT	 i.*,3 AS sort FROM info AS i WHERE age >= 18  AND sex = 0  ORDER BY convert('name' using gbk) asc LIMIT 999999)
UNION ALL
(SELECT	 i.*,4 AS sort FROM info AS i WHERE age >= 18  AND sex = 1  ORDER BY convert('name' using gbk) asc LIMIT 999999)
```
