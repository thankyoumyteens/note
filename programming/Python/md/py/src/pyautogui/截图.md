## python3.12 截图报错

报错:

```sh
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "C:\cv2_demo.py", line 99, in <module>
    pyautogui.screenshot('screen.png', region=(0, 0, 1920, 1080))
  File "C:\Python312\Lib\site-packages\pyautogui\__init__.py", line 228, in _couldNotImportPyScreeze
    raise PyAutoGUIException(
pyautogui.PyAutoGUIException: PyAutoGUI was unable to import pyscreeze. (This is likely because you're running a version of Python that Pillow (which pyscreeze depends on) doesn't support currently.) Please install this module to enable the function you tried to call.
```

解决:

```sh
pip install --upgrade Pillow
```
