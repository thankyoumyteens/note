# 1.1 A Bit of History

Java 语言是一个通用的, 支持并发的面向对象语言。它的语法和 C/C++类似, 但它去掉了 C/C++中复杂难懂和不安全的用法。Java
平台一开始是为了开发能联网的消费级设备上的软件而设计的。它支持多主机架构并且支持软件组件的安全分发。 为了满足这些要求, 编译后的代码需要通过网络传输, 在任意客户端上安全地运行。

The popularization of the World Wide Web made these attributes much more
interesting. Web browsers enabled millions of people to surf the Net and access
media-rich content in simple ways. At last there was a medium where what you
saw and heard was essentially the same regardless of the machine you were using
and whether it was connected to a fast network or a slow modem.

Web enthusiasts soon discovered that the content supported by the Web's HTML
document format was too limited. HTML extensions, such as forms, only
highlighted those limitations, while making it clear that no browser could include
all the features users wanted. Extensibility was the answer.

The HotJava browser first showcased the interesting properties of the Java
programming language and platform by making it possible to embed programs
inside HTML pages. Programs are transparently downloaded into the browser
along with the HTML pages in which they appear. Before being accepted by the
browser, programs are carefully checked to make sure they are safe. Like HTML
pages, compiled programs are network- and host-independent. The programs
behave the same way regardless of where they come from or what kind of machine
they are being loaded into and run on.

A Web browser incorporating the Java platform is no longer limited to a
predetermined set of capabilities. Visitors to Web pages incorporating dynamic
content can be assured that their machines cannot be damaged by that content.
Programmers can write a program once, and it will run on any machine supplying
a Java run-time environment.
