# Median of Two Sorted Arrays

There are two sorted arrays nums1 and nums2 of size m and n respectively.

Find the median of the two sorted arrays. The overall run time complexity should be O(log (m+n)).

You may assume nums1 and nums2 cannot be both empty.

求两个有序数组组合起来的中位数，而且限制了时间复杂度为 O(log (m+n))

# 例子

```
nums1 = [1, 3]
nums2 = [2]

The median is 2.0
```

```
nums1 = [1, 2]
nums2 = [3, 4]

The median is (2 + 3)/2 = 2.5
```
